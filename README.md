# ODEs_ LSTM_ Solutions. 
A deep learning model to solve stochastic ODEs (i.e., Pandemic spreading ODE model).
pdf report (http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11124.94086).
define the number of trained samples in the file named 'Data generation and Model Development.py' and run it.
make sure you've downloaded all required LSTM Libraries.to ensure better results use PyCharm compiler and python editor.
send an email to: mhmd_hussein@s.upc.edu.cn to get the training data.
# Make sure you have enough memory and high-performance computing unit.
