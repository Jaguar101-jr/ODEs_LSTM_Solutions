# ODEs_LSTM_Solutions. 
A deep learning model to solve stochastic ODEs (i.e., Pandamic spreading ODE model).
define the number of trained sample in the file named 'Data generation and Model Development.py' and run it.
make sure you've downloaded all required LSTM Libraries.to insure better results use pycharm compiler and python editor.

# make sure you have enough memory and high performance computing unit.
