# ODEs_LSTM_Solutions. 
A deep learning model to solve stochastic ODEs (i.e., Pandamic spreading ODE model).
pdf report (http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11124.94086).
define the number of trained sample in the file named 'Data generation and Model Development.py' and run it.
make sure you've downloaded all required LSTM Libraries.to insure better results use pycharm compiler and python editor.
send an email to: mhmd_hussein@s.upc.edu.cn to get the trainig data.
# make sure you have enough memory and high performance computing unit.
